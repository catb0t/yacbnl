yet another c big number library
YACBiNuLi, "yak-binewly"

a single-header lightweight C arbitrary precision library using uint16_t* arrays.

written in C99, probably compiles in C11 too.

the tests need the excellent criterion testing framework http://github.com/snaipe/criterion

binaries I accidentally commit are unoptimised, debug ELFs built on and for Linux x64 kernel 4.x
